# Spring Data JPA Ð¸ Kotlin
REST API for project management

queries are implemented in the project

Project Management:
GET /projects - Get a list of projects.
POST /projects - Create a new project.
PUT /projects/:id - Edit a project.
DELETE /projects/:id - Deleting a project.

there is a file for Postman in the project root
Heroku.postman_collection.json
which already contains requests to the external server
https://kotlin-rest-api-e5bf80c4b125.herokuapp.com/projects
with typed test data for PUT and POST requests 

I realized the main part of the task, because it was interesting 
for me to learn a new language Kotlin and to learn how to make 
a deploy. If necessary, I can do an additional task for the test. 

aplication.yml - is configured to run on a remote server, so I do 
not provide requirements for local launch.
The project is currently running and available at the external link
